Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: Data from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.


In this repository you will find 3 items:
1. CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations     or work that I performed to clean up the data

2. run_analysis.R cleans the data and then follows 5 steps as outlined in the assignment:
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each             measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the      average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


3. The end result is a clean data set in the file, FinalAssignmentData.txt.
