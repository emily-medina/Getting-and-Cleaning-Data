title: "Codebook"

The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition.

Download the dataset: UCI HAR Dataset

make variable names for each data set

features - 'features.txt': List of all features.

activitylabels- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

subjecttest- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

xtrain- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

ytrain- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

xtest- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

ytest- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.


Merging training and test sets
x (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test with the rbind() function
y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test with the rbind() function
subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test with the rbind() function
cleandata (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging subject, y and x with thecbind() function

Extracts only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
seconddata (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting cleandata, but only including columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the cleandata replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the  activities variable

labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in cleandata renamed into activities
'Acc' in column name replaced by 'Accelerometer'
'Gyro' in column name replaced by 'Gyroscope'
'BodyBody' in column name replaced by 'Body'
'Mag' in column name replaced by 'Magnitude'
character 'f' in beginning of column name replaced by 'Frequency'
character 't' in beginning of column name replaced by 'Time'

Using the data set in step 4, creates a second data set with the averages of each variable for each activity and each subject

seconddata (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing cleandata taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.

export seconddata into FinalAssignmentData.txt file.
